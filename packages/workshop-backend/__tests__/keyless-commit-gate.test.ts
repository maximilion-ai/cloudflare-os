// authorizeCollaborator's commit gate must re-check the caller's live role for *every*
// verification, not just share-key redemptions. A keyless open parks in ensureObserver across
// real await windows (verifier RPCs, even the configuration modal), and a removal landing there
// used to be caught only by the revocation restart -- which fires after the teardown/listing
// phases, so a verification resolving inside that window slipped through: step 6's blind
// observers.put *resurrected* the record tearDownLostObservers had just deleted (record and
// account choices were loaded pre-park), leaving a removed user with coverage that a later
// re-grant would trust without re-verification, and the open returned a full stale-role
// capability besides. The gate now denies at commit time, and the post-verification role
// re-derivation (previously redemption-only) caps a mid-park downgrade at the live role.
//
// Runs against a real OverseerDurableObject (the TEST_OVERSEER binding, like
// verification-scope.test.ts); the gatekeeper facet and the client's User DO are the fakes. Bob
// is a *returning* collaborator (persisted covering record), so the open parks inside step 5's
// addObserver -- no configuration modal is involved.
//
// The first describe drives authorizeCollaborator directly. The second drives the production
// open() entry point, which reaches the same gate through authorizeCollaborator: a keyless
// open() must deny a mid-park removal without resurrecting the record, and a mid-park downgrade
// must hand back the restricted "use" capability rather than the full interface the stale role
// selected.
